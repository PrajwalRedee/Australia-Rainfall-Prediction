# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

The Rain in Australia dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

As a data scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology, you are tasked with creating a fully-automated system that can use today's weather data for a given location to predict whether it will rain at the location tomorrow.
