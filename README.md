QUESTION: The Rain in Australia dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

As a data scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology, you are tasked with creating a fully-automated system that can use today's weather data for a given location to predict whether it will rain at the location tomorrow.

The dataset can be downloaded from the above url.

## Roadmap

- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
- Dealing with missing numbers using SimpleImputer
- Training the model using Logistic Regression
- Taining the model using Decision Tree
- Evaluating using Accuracy and confusion matrix
